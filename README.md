Technical Test @ Doctolib

The goal is to write an algorithm that checks the availabilities of an agenda depending of the events attached to it. The main method has a start date for input and is looking for the availabilities of the next 7 days.

They are two kinds of events:

‘opening’, are the openings for a specific day and they can be recurring week by week.
‘appointment’, times when the doctor is already booked.

Your Mission:

must pass the unit tests below
add tests for edge cases
be pragmatic about performance
SQLite compatible
